# Simple world view for fonts

The different styles use a lot of the same fonts; this is the Roboto Noto fonts from https://github.com/openmaptiles/fonts (and Google)

Rather than having a full suite of fonts only the three most used fonts are included. There's also "Compressed Italic" but for simplicity's sake the styles uses just the "Italic" font.
